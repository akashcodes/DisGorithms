# Distributed Algorithms (on MPI)

## Currently has the following algorithms - 
### Leader Election
1. Simple Leader Election (Simple Voting)
2. Randomised Distributed Leader Election (RandLE) | WIP. Reference -  Distributed Network Algorithms

### Sorting
1. Quicksort

### Graph Traversal
1. BFS

### Mathematics
1. Matrix Multiplication

### Data
1. K Means


## To Run -
1. Make sure to set-up a LAN cluster
2. Compile the programs using mpicc (I used MPICH 3.0)
3. Run using mpirun command
